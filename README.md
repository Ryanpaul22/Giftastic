homework

I can not figure out how to capture what the user inputs into the "search" bar
I can not figure out a way to add more elements to the "topics" array
I cannot figure out how to interact with the buttons that my for-loop creates from my "topics" array
I'm having a tough time with this, not sure what I can do next. Sorry
