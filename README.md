homework
I had an incredibly hard time with this assignment. I could not figure out how to interact with the buttons that were created on my html from my for-loop topics away, nor could I figure out how to interact with the "add an animal" search bar. The whole point of this assignment, working with API's, was no where near accomplished. I successfully added an API key to my JS, but thats it. Been stuck with no progress for a few hours, so I'm calling it quits for now.
